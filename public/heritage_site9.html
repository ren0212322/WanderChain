        <strong>Description:</strong> The Roman Agora is a large public space
        located to the north of the Ancient Agora of Athens. It was developed
        during the Roman period and features several important buildings and
        structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>History:</strong> Constructed during the 1st century BC and 1st
        century AD, the Roman Agora included a marketplace, public baths, and a
        large colonnaded courtyard. Key structures include the Gate of Athena
        Archegetis and the Tower of the Winds, a unique octagonal structure that
        served as a clocktower and meteorological station.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Roman Agora reflects the influence of Roman architecture and urban
        planning on Athens, showcasing a blend of Greek and Roman cultural
        elements.
