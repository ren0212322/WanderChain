        <strong>Description:</strong> The Temple of Olympian Zeus, also known as
        the Olympieion, is a colossal ancient temple dedicated to Zeus, the king
        of the Greek gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>History:</strong> Construction of the temple began in the 6th
        century BC under the tyrant Peisistratus and was completed in the 2nd
        century AD by the Roman emperor Hadrian. The temple originally consisted
        of 104 Corinthian columns, of which 15 still stand today. It was the
        largest temple in Greece and was intended to rival the Parthenon in
        grandeur.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site was also associated with various religious festivals and
        ceremonies in honor of Zeus. Despite its incomplete state, the remains
        of the temple continue to impress visitors with its sheer scale and
        architectural innovation.
