        <strong>Description:</strong> The Stoa of Attalos was a covered walkway
        or portico located in the Ancient Agora of Athens. It was used for
        commercial and social activities and was one of the most significant
        structures in the Agora.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>History:</strong> Built in the 2nd century BC by King Attalos II
        of Pergamon, the Stoa was reconstructed in the 1950s to its original
        design. It consisted of two stories and was adorned with columns in the
        Doric and Ionic orders. The structure provided shelter for merchants and
        philosophers and served as a prominent architectural feature of the
        Agora.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Stoa of Attalos now houses a museum with exhibits related to
        Athenian daily life and artifacts uncovered from the Agora.
